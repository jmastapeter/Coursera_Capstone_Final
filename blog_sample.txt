To me that is wrong There should be intellectual rights for a pattern you bet No one should be able to claim a pattern that is not theirs And no one should be able to take a pattern and mass produce an item to create an empire out of it But there is no harm in someone having the ability to work a craft fair or two Or sell to a local boutique or two If the designer asks you not to sell in a certain place then by all means respect that but to say that NOTHING you make from that pattern is saleableyeah well you know what I think"

I can see that working if he was trying to pull a fast one on the Silence or all the creatures of the Universe But Time itself? The reason the alternate world was created where history was all happening at once was because the Doctors Death was a fixed point in time and it didnt happen River changed a fixed point in time and made that happen because Time has rules of engagement and when Time Lords or Children if Time dont play by the rules of Time everything goes wonky with serious consequences So Moffat do you really think that because the Doctor hid inside of a frakkin android that this could actually fool Time itself? Really? If Rivers refusal to kill him caused Time to collapse in on itself surely his own plan to cheat death should have caused another collapse And how did the fake Teselecta body gain the ability to start the regeneration process where all the time vortex stuff bursts out of every appendage?

Would Churchill have had an army of research assistants Tweeting constant updates on the life of the Duke of Marlborough manuscript in progress and if so would the Tweets have obviated the need for anyone to buy the book when complete?"

I said yes they were stupendous but I thought that this was perhaps the key to the problem although the narrative is purportedly a shifting intimate third rather than omniscient on the whole I felt those descriptions were made from an authorial viewpoint rather than that of the characters I wouldnt say that the descriptions were exactly touristic but the sense of appreciation of the beauty and grandeur was often at odds with the situations and psychic journeys of the characters Jenny said Yes the farming characters would probably find the landscape pretty grim wouldnt they? As well as that basic matter of the attitude to the landscape theres also the question of the metaphorical language in which its described I did think it worked brilliantly for the psyche of the skin doctor who buys up Loyals fields to build himself an outback retreat and whose emotional focus is indeed the landscape to which he looks for succour but which overwhelms him"

As our conversation went on I noticed Eric was all for the idea of wanting to adopt and having our own children FIRST didnt seem to be a priority to him anymore I couldnt believe it I was so thrilled And if anyone knows my husband you know he is a bit impulsive whereas I am more analytical and need to think out every decision especially those big life decisions Well when Eric said lets do this there was no analyzing that situation It was amazing how happy I felt and excited that I was going to be a mom It wasnt until then that I realized I DO want to have a family I DO want to be a mom All those feelings I had before werent about not wanting a family its just more the nervouness about being pregnant which I still cannot really explain my feelings about this Thats just the way I feel Having a family isnt just about physically having a child its about loving and taking care of him no matter how he comes into the world "

Did the persons that attended to your concern in a government agency were as nice as the attendants in a private bank or even in a fast food restaurant? So tell about the time when you had to renew your drivers license how long did it took and more importantly was the service really that good?
